Corrections applied to stereodescriptors assume the input's connectivity, but this is a structural discrepancy. \n- The original product SMILES incorrectly included an iodine atom ('I') instead of an isopropyl alcohol group; this was a major chemical error and has been corrected by deriving the product SMILES from the corrected reactant SMILES by only performing the acetonide hydrolysis, maintaining the core connectivity as present in the reactant's corrected SMILES. \nAll other explicit chiral centers had their stereodescriptors (`@`, `@@`) adjusted to match the wedges/dashes in the screenshot, and the benzyl group was abbreviated to `[OBn]` as shown in the image.",
