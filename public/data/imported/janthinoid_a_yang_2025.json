The chiral center stereochemistry of the reactant (S, anti-diol) and the epoxide stereochemistry of the product (cis-epoxide) were corrected to accurately reflect the drawn structures. Note a potential stereochemical inconsistency: the reactant is depicted as an anti-diol, while the product is depicted as a cis-epoxide. A cis-epoxide typically forms from a syn-diol via intramolecular SN2, suggesting a discrepancy between the drawn reactant and product structures if formed directly.",
