The reactant is shown as (S) configuration at the carbon bearing the tert-butyl group. The product is drawn as (R) configuration for the corresponding alcohol. This implies either an SN1-like opening or an inversion at the chiral center, which is unusual for attack at the terminal carbon of a disubstituted epoxide, where retention of configuration at the substituted chiral center is typically expected.
