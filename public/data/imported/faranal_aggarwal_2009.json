This transformation involves the addition of an ethyl group and an iodine atom across the alkyne. However, the regioselectivity implied by the drawn product (addition of ethyl to terminal carbon, and iodine replacing the other metal on the internal carbon, or a different alkyne) appears inconsistent with the typical regioselectivity of Zr-catalyzed carboalumination of terminal alkynes (which would typically place the ethyl group on the internal carbon and the Al-moiety on the terminal carbon).",
