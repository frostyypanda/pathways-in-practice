However, simultaneously, the tert-butyl ketone moiety in the reactant is converted to a tert-butyl ester in the product. This latter transformation (ketone to ester) is typically a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or similar rearrangement, which is not usually accomplished with EthynylMgBr under these conditions. This suggests either a multi-step reaction summarized as one, or an implied oxidant/rearrangement is missing from the reagent list for the ketone to ester conversion.",
