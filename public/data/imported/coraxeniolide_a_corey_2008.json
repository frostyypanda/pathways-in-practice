However, the product shows an alkene and TMS ether, suggesting a dehydration rather than cyclization with the primary alcohol. The reaction appears to be a Mitsunobu-mediated elimination to form the double bond and then protection of the remaining hydroxyl (the one originally at the bridgehead) as a TMS ether. The initial Mitsunobu step would likely involve the primary alcohol and the tertiary alcohol to form a cyclic ether. However, the product shows an alkene and a TMS-protected alcohol. This suggests either a complex sequence or a different mechanism. Given DEAD, PPh3, it's typically a Mitsunobu reaction. If the intent was intramolecular ether formation, the product would be a fused ring system with an ether bridge, which is not what's shown. The product shows a dehydration and TMS protection. This is an unusual outcome for a direct Mitsunobu on this substrate for that product. It's more likely an elimination to form the double bond, and the remaining hydroxyl is protected. The original primary alcohol must be involved in the elimination.",
