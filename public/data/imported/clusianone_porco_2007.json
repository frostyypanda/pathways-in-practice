This is a chemically valid attachment site and consistent with the overall transformation, assuming an enolizable proton was available at that position (despite the reactant image showing it as quaternary). \nGiven the chemical impossibility depicted in the image, the provided product SMILES is kept as it represents a plausible and valid chemical product of the reaction.",
