A standard Wolff-Kishner reduction (aldehyde to methyl group) applied to either reactant would yield a different product (1,8-dimethyl-4-isopropylazulene from the first reactant, or 1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene from the second reactant). The product shown in the image is also labelled 'Guaiazulene', which is typically 1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene, a structure that differs from the drawn product. Thus, there is a discrepancy between the drawn product structure, the labelled product name, and the stated reaction type given the reactants.",
