The provided SMILES reflects the most chemically plausible interpretation of the intended product structure, where the double bond is formed between the ketone carbon and the less substituted alpha carbon (C1=C2), allowing the adjacent chiral center (C6) to retain its two substituents (allyl and reduced propargyl chain).",
