The starting material is a C40 polyisoprenoid chain, where one of the terminal C=C(CH3)2 groups undergoes regioselective and stereoselective addition to form the bromohydrin. All internal double bonds retain their E (trans) stereochemistry. The label 'Omaezakianol (Corey 2010)' typically refers to a C35 compound, which conflicts with the C40 structure visually represented in the screenshot for both reactant and product. The SMILES are generated based on the visual information from the screenshot, assuming a C40 carbon skeleton.",
