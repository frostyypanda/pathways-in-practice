The hydroxyl group is eliminated and a new C-N bond is formed. The screenshot visually depicts only one methyl group on the bridgehead carbon for both reactant and product. However, the canonical structures for named compounds like Aristotelone and Alloaristoteline typically feature two methyl groups (one on a bridgehead and one as part of an isopropyl group). The provided SMILES reflect the canonical C20 structures, with a note about this visual discrepancy. The wavy bond for the hydroxyl group in the reactant implies undefined or racemic stereochemistry at that center, which is correctly handled by not assigning explicit stereochemistry for the OH-bearing carbon in the SMILES.",
