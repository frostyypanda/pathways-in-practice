The initial reactant SMILES incorrectly described the bicyclic core as 1,1,7,7-tetramethyl instead of 1,7,7-trimethyl. This was corrected, and explicit stereochemistry was added to match the image. The product SMILES also had the same core error and was corrected accordingly. A significant discrepancy exists in the product image: the C4 bridgehead carbon is depicted with both a methyl group and the new 4-oxopentyl chain, in addition to its three ring bonds, implying 5 bonds to carbon, which is chemically impossible. The product SMILES has been generated based on the chemically plausible assumption that the reaction replaced a hydrogen at the C4 bridgehead with the 4-oxopentyl chain, and that the extra methyl group shown at C4 in the product drawing is an error.",
